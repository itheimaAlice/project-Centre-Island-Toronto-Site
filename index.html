				<h3>Centre island is the middle of the three primary Toronto Island destinations. </h3>
				<p>Boats go more often to Centre than the other islands because it's the most popular. You will find fountains, formal gardens, Centerville Amusement Park, a pier that extends into Lake Ontario, a sandy beach, picnic areas, Franklin's Children's Garden and many other attractions.The ferry ride to Centre is 10-15 minutes from the Jack Layton Ferry Terminal. <a>See Toronto Islands ferry schedule.</a></p>

						<p>Many people who visit Centre Island go there to cook something on the barbie, have a family picnic on the island, have fun at Centreville Park, visit the petting zoo, go the beach or just walk around and enjoy some quiet time away from the city. You can grab a pizza by the ferry docks or by the pier - both are Pizza Pizza outlets - or you can eat at one of many other restaurants, and snack bars, some of them licensed. The busiest restaurants on Centre Island are the Carousel Cafe and the new Toronto Island BBQ & Beer Co. adjacent to the Centre Island ferry docks. The boathouse is also located on Centre Island.</p>

						<p>Centre Island is also home to the Island Public and Natural Science school that goes up to grade six. Its students either live on the Island or in apartments and condos along the waterfront. They come to school each morning on the ferry! There is also a water treatment facilty, facility on Centre along with Artscape's Gibraltar Point Centre for the Arts, an artist's retreat with studio rentals. The Gibraltar Lighthouse is the oldest lighthouse on the Great Lakes dating back to 1808. It is rumoured that the ghost of JP Rademueller, the first lighthouse keeper who was murdered by two soldiers at Fort York, comes back every summer to haunt the lighthouse,. On the night of a full moon, his screams can be heard from one end of the Island to the other.</p>
